# Data-Compression
A novel image compression method combines Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and Huffman coding. The algorithm rearranges data using BWT, then assigns shorter codes to frequent characters with Huffman coding. Results show improved compression ratios and efficient encoding/decoding, ideal for large image storage and transmission.
